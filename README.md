# ü§ñ Autonomous DevOps Healing Agent

## üöÄ Overview
This project showcases an **Autonomous DevOps Healing Agent** designed to automatically detect and remediate service outages in a containerized environment with **zero human intervention**.  
By integrating cutting-edge AI (Large Language Models) with a robust monitoring and alerting stack, it acts as a **proactive Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**, ensuring high availability and significantly reducing **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)** for critical web services.

---

## üí° The Problem It Solves
In modern microservices architectures, services can frequently experience degradation or outright crashes due to various factors like memory leaks, sudden high load, or underlying code issues.  
Manually detecting these outages, diagnosing the root cause, and initiating recovery actions is a time-consuming process, prone to human error, and directly impacts service availability.  
This project provides an automated, intelligent solution to this challenge, demonstrating **true self-healing capabilities**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built as a **multi-container Docker Compose** application, orchestrating the following key components:

- **webapp (Python Flask):**  
  A simple web application intentionally designed with a memory leak. This simulates real-world service degradation and crashes when subjected to sustained load. *(Scaled to 3 instances for distributed testing)*

- **nginx (Reverse Proxy/Load Balancer):**  
  Serves as the frontend, distributing incoming traffic to the webapp instances and exposing the service to external clients.

- **prometheus (Monitoring):**  
  Continuously scrapes metrics (e.g., health status, resource usage) from all webapp instances and other services. It stores this time-series data and is configured with alert rules to detect service outages.

- **alertmanager (Alerting):**  
  Receives alerts from Prometheus, deduplicates, groups, and routes them to configured receivers. In this setup, it sends webhooks to the webhook-receiver.

- **webhook-receiver (LLM Agent - Python Flask):**  
  This is the brain of the autonomous healing system. It's a Flask application that serves as a webhook endpoint for Alertmanager. Upon receiving an alert, it triggers an intelligent agent to diagnose and act.

- **LangChain & Google Gemini API (LLM Agent Logic):**  
  The Python LLM agent utilizes the **LangChain** framework to orchestrate its reasoning and action-taking. It leverages the power of **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to dynamically diagnose the problem based on observed data and execute remediation steps.

- **locust (Load Testing):**  
  Used to generate high concurrent load on the webapp services via nginx, simulating traffic spikes that lead to service crashes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automated Crash Detection:**  
  Prometheus alerts are configured to detect when webapp instances become DOWN or unhealthy for a short duration.

- **Dynamic LLM Diagnosis:**  
  The AI agent (using a custom `list_webapp_status` tool) can dynamically identify all webapp containers that are in an exited or unhealthy state, without requiring hardcoded container names.

- **Autonomous Multi-Instance Restart:**  
  The LLM agent intelligently decides to use the `restart_container` tool to bring all affected webapp instances back online.

- **Zero Human Intervention:**  
  The entire process from outage detection to recovery is fully automated.

- **Scalable Solution:**  
  Designed to work with multiple, dynamically named service instances.

- **Observability:**  
  Integrated Grafana dashboard for visualizing performance and health metrics.

## üîÅ How It Works (The Healing Flow)

1. **Service Degradation:**  
   Locust generates heavy, concurrent load on the webapp services via Nginx.

2. **Crash Trigger:**  
   Due to the engineered memory leak in the webapp application and configured memory limits, the webapp containers hit their resource ceiling and are terminated by Docker, entering an Exited (137) state. Crucially, they do not automatically restart at this stage.

3. **Alerting:**
   - Prometheus's scrape attempts fail for the crashed webapp instances, marking them DOWN.
   - A `WebappInstanceDown` alert fires in Prometheus, indicating a persistent outage.
   - Prometheus sends this alert to Alertmanager.

4. **LLM Agent Trigger:**  
   Alertmanager receives the alert and, via a webhook, sends a notification to the webhook-receiver (LLM Agent) service. Alertmanager is configured with a short `repeat_interval` to re-notify if the problem persists.

5. **Autonomous Diagnosis:**
   - The webhook-receiver's Flask application triggers the LangChain-powered LLM agent.
   - The LLM agent's prompt guides it to first confirm the overall webapp health (which will be down).
   - It then uses the `list_webapp_status` tool to get a dynamic list of all `devopsagent-webapp-X` containers and their exact Docker statuses.

6. **Autonomous Remediation:**
   - Based on the tool's output, the LLM intelligently identifies all exited or unhealthy webapp instances.
   - For each identified instance, it invokes the `restart_container` tool with the specific container name. This tool interacts directly with the Docker daemon to bring the container back online.

7. **Verification:**  
   After attempting restarts for all identified down containers, the LLM agent uses `check_webapp_health` again to confirm that the overall webapp frontend is back online, completing its healing cycle.

8. **Continuous Monitoring:**  
   If the webapp continues to crash due to sustained Locust load, the entire cycle repeats, demonstrating continuous self-healing capabilities.

## üöÄ Setup & Running Locally

### üîß Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (with Docker Engine running)  
- Git  
- Python 3.9+  
- A Google Cloud Project with the Generative Language API enabled and a valid API Key (ensure sufficient quota for testing)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samridh-Minocha007/autonomous-devops-agent.git
cd autonomous-devops-agent
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory (same level as `docker-compose.yaml`)  
Add your Google Gemini API Key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GENERATED_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

#### 3. Start the Autonomous Agent Stack

This command will build your custom webapp and webhook-receiver images, download other services, and start everything. It will scale webapp to 3 instances.

```bash
docker compose up --build --scale webapp=3 -d
```

#### 4. Verify All Containers Are Running and Healthy Initially

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see `nginx-proxy`, `webhook-receiver`, `prometheus`, `grafana`, `alertmanager`, and **three** `devopsagent-webapp-X` containers, with webapp instances showing **healthy**.
